<=====TUPLE=====>

immutable lists - ordered & non- unique  means duplicate nad indexing are allowed 

- (numbers of values seperated by commas) 
- tuples are immutable that means once created cant be modified
- tuples are more faster than lists - occupy less memory than lists 
- tuples are kind of Read-Only lits 
 
my_tuple = ()
my_tuple[]
my_tuple[::]

in 
not in

dir(())
help(())

NOTE : no add , remove or modify  etc...  cuz its immutable

------------
Tuple assignment (unpacking) :

assign tuple of varibales of a tuple of values and map them together


tuple1 = ("hossam", "24" , "python")
(name, age ,lang)= tuple1

OR 

("hossam", "24" , "python") = (name, age ,lang)

NOTE : must be same no. of elements
-----------
min()
max() 

tuple.count(x)
tuple.index(x)

tuple * 2    			print tuple multiple times 
tuple1 + tuple2 		print concatenated tuples

del tuple 			delete entire tuple

NOTE : when u are creating a tuple of single item , it actually dont create a tuple but instead
ceates an inter or string to avoid this use comma in the end
